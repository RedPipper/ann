- neural_network.py -> self implementation of a neural network that can be initialized with a variable number of layers and nodes per layer
- main.py -> training and testing of my own implementation of the neural network over iris dataset and handwritten digits dataset (sklearn)

- main_tool.py -> training and testing of a neural network and a convolutional neural network over 600x600 input images with or without a sepia filter applied to them (filter.py for more details)
